# Challenge #1 - Code Refactor

## Description

    This project was about cleaning up and refactoring code that builds the Horiseon website. The site needed to be more accessible and optimized for search engines, but remain unchanged visually.

## Changes

    I changed some of the semantic HTML elements, added alt attributes to the anchor tags, fixed a broken link within the header section, and combined similar CSS classes to make the code easier to read and for the browser to run.

## Experience Gained

    By refactoring code that I had not originally written, I gained experience in finding small errors that would have gone unnoticed. Particularly, changing the tag names in the CSS file. That small change in just a few areas drastically changed the appearance of the site until I was able to locate the errors. 

    Overall, the source code for the Horiseon site is now easier to read and much more accessible to the site's audience. It also retains the original visual appearance and intended navigation links.
